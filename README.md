# NYC Citi Bike Analysis
## Overview of Statistical Analysis:
Everyone knows about the ridesharing companies like Uber and Lyft. These companies came and took the transportation industry by storm with their ridesharing business model. Instead of calling a yellowcab and waiting on some unidentified taxi driver to show up a rider can now order the type of service they need and know exactly who will be doing the pickup. This is a luxury that many have grown to appreciate. Citi Bike is a subsidiary of Lyft and offers riders the option to rent a bike to ride in downtown Manhattan and surrounding areas. For those who do not need a car but enjoy the freedom of a leisure bike ride Citi Bike offers a wonderful pricing model with single rentals or a subscription for unlimited rides. The purpose of this analysis is to dive deep into what Citi Bike has to offer the NYC area and see if those same benefits will be appreciated in Des Moines, Iowa. If the numbers add up the business could be expanding into that area of the world.

Citi Bike has proven without a doubt that the bike ridesharing model is a hot commodity in the NYC area. With all of foot traffic in this city it should not be surprising that a bikesharing company would do well. The market is available and the product matches the needs of the market. Based on the millions of Citi Bike rides taken in 2019 it is no wonder the company is thinking about expanding to untapped markets. If the business model is followed there should not be any reason why the business would not be successful in another city. Men and women both have shown that they appreciate the convenience that bike ridesharing offers. Within the analysis we see that there is a higher percentage of male riders although women are riding at a high level as well. 

## Results

### Rides by Gender

This visualization identifies the number of trips that are being taken by the various genders. What the image is showing is what days of the week experiences higher rides further drilled down to the gender of the rider. It is worth analyzing the difference in the number of male versus women riders. If the rides are primarily being taken by men than that is the population that should be marketed to. 

### Ride Duration

The above visualization helps to reveal how long the average ride lasts. This means how long a rider keeps the bike they have rented. Based on the image most of the rides last about 15 minutes before the bike is returned. In some cases the bike has been kept for well over an hour. These types of rides do not occur often so an analysis would see this type of trip as an outlier. Most rides will be under 20 minutes. Pricing strategies should be implemented with this figure in mind.

### Ride Duration by Gender

In looking at the above referenced image it is clear to see that men ride for a longer duration than women and the unknown gender category. So men represent the largest population of riders as well as the dominating population in terms of ride duration. These are essential talking points because further analysis could be done to determine whether the male riders are dropping off their bikes a further distance away than the shorter rides being taken by women. 

### Rides by the Day of the Week
From an investor viewpoint it is important to analyze data based on time. This analysis is all about the time that riders are taking advantage of the Citi bikes. The below image shows the amount of rides occuring at each hour of the day. Based on the visualization it is possible to see the time of day when the most rides take place. It is also possible to see which day of the week majority of the rides occur as well. These are great figures to examine when forecasting for future revenue.

We can also look at the same information and have it broken out by gender for day of the week. With this visualization we are able to determine what are the popular days for each of the genders to take part in bike ridesharing. Knowing this will also answer the question of how to market to these individuals based on their custom needs.

## Summary:
Throughout this analysis we can see the Citi Bike ridesharing model is producing great results. The excitement that is being felt around this business model is trickling into other areas of the country. Soon cities like Des Moines can experience what NYC has been enjoying for some time now. With additional analysis such as figuring out the peak hours of operation will further solidify this business venture.

Lastly, we see that this area of Manhattan is a hot spot for Citi Bike ridesharing. The same model can be revealed once Des Moines takes hold of the idea and begins offering bike ridesharing to its citizens.
